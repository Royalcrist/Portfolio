                        Since I was a child I have been curious about the technological world and I've loved it from the first moment I discovered it. So when I was around 8 years old, I decided to start learning about computer science and design. Since then I haven't stopped learning.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        At 12 I started programming and at 14 I started designing, facts that have changed my life forever. Best of all, I love both worlds, because incurring both allows me to be in all stages of the product; from birth to deployment.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        As I always liked to create things that solve problems in my day to day, when I learned to develop software it was like magic, suddenly all those creations that I had in my mind could make them come alive.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        "the most complex problems has the most simple solutions"<br/>
                        <br/>
                        In addition, the fact that someone has positively influenced one of the solutions I created motivates me to continue giving my best and never stop innovating.<br/>
